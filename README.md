# Twilio Flex Plugin - Auto complete during wrap up

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

This plugin will automatically complete the task during the wrap up phase. The time for the task to be completed can be configured using ui_attributes. This [documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/configuration#modifying-configuration-for-flextwiliocom) provides information on how to configure the ui_attributes.

Sample demo is provided below :

The plugin will first check if the configuration for auto wrapup timer is defined or not. If the configuration
is not found within ui_attributes then we will show a notification as below:

Any incoming task will be completed as shown below :

## Dependencies

This plugin relies on custom configuration being applied to your underlying [Flex Configuration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/configuration#modifying-configuration-for-flextwiliocom)

For each channel you want to add an entry to the following ui_attributes element.

```bash
"autoWrapupTimer": {
  "channel name" :  {
    "enabled" : "true or false",
    "maxSeconds": "time for auto complete"
  }
}
```

For example :

```bash
"autoWrapupTimer": {
  "voice": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxSeconds": 30
  },
  "chat": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```
